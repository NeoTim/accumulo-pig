title: Accumulo Storage with Pig 
--- 
<p> <a href="http://accumulo.apache.org">Apache Accumulo</a> is a sorted, distributed, key-value store built using <a
href="http://hadoop.apache.org">Apache Hadoop</a> and <a href="http://zookeeper.apache.org">Apache ZooKeeper</a>. <a
href="http://pig.apache.org">Apache Pig</a> is a platform for analyzing large data sets using a high-level expression
language, <em>Pig Latin</em>. This project intends to provide the mechanisms for storage and retrieval of data stored in
Accumulo using Pig's expression language </p>

<p> This work was initially based on a contribution by Jason Trost to Apache Accumulo, but has been recently revitalized
to ensure compatibility with all stable versions of Apache Accumulo as well as supporting as much of Pig Latin's
functionality as efficiently as possible. Many decisions were influenced by the functionality that <em>HBaseStorage</em>
that currently exists in Pig.</p>

<p> The code can be viewed at <a href="http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=accumulo-pig.git">accumulo-pig.git</a>
or can be cloned using <a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a>
